# all crypto whitepapers

I assembled this collection to NLP on. Free to use, free to learn from. Enjoy! PRs are welcome :)

Not all of these are PDF format, some are saved in text from HTML pages. I try to get PDFs but if I can't find one,
I just try to save it as a .txt file with only text and no markup.

If you make a PR, please make sure to save the file as either PDF or text and make an entry into the __papers-index.csv__ file!


### Development

I wrote a script to make entries to the index and download PDFs. It is still a very manual process.

To run locally install node 8 + npm and run npm install first.
